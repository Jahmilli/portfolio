        The capstone project I worked on in 2020 with two other friends. This
        project was an attempt at building a mobile application that would
        record a basketball playerâ€™s freethrow, analyse the keypoints detected
        within the video and process them against a series of algorithms to
        provide feedback on how to improve.

        An Android application developed to connect people that want to
        volunteer for charity events. Some of the main features this included
        were the ability for creation of volunteer and charity profiles.
        Charities could create events, manage volunteers for an event as well as
        rate volunteers. Volunteers could register for events, view events on a
        map as well as had a history of the events they attended and what they
        were rated for the event.

            emailing volunteers when they had been accepted to an event, removed
            from an event, when an event was about to start or the event had
            been cancelled.
