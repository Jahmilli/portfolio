At the very beginning I was told (by someone\n        close to me) I shouldn't get into this field because I wouldn't be able\n        to keep up with everyone and I did struggle quite a bit understanding\n        basic programming concepts at the very start. However with a fair bit of\n        studying and side-projects I was able to catchup build my skills to\n        where I am today.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Throughout university I have been able to continually build both\n        technical and social skills. During my time, I have supported two\n        societies, one being the UTS Professional Aeronautics & Astronautics\n        Society (PAAS) which I joined at it's very inception in 2017. I was the\n        Vice President of this society for two years helping ideate and organise\n        a variety of social, industry based and technical events to help foster\n        interest and social interaction between students at UTS as well at UNSW\n        and USYD with a common interest in space!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        During my time supporting PAAS I also assisted in helping out a Meetup\n        known as OrbitOz run at a variety of locations (Fishburners, UTS,\n        Atlassian, even a rooftop bar in Adelaide during the 2017 International\n        Astronautical Congress where they announced the Australian Space\n        Agency!){\" \"}\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I also worked as a treasurer on the UTS Programmers' Society helping\n        ensure the society ran smoothly throughout the 2018 helping organise a\n        Hackathon, Programming Competition as well as programming workshops and\n        other social events.\n      </p>\n      <h3>A brief overview of my work life</h3>\n      <p>\n        My career in software development started in 2018 as a DevOps\n        Engineering intern through the NAB Industry Based Learning (IBL) program\n        which I developed skills around the devops space focusing on automation,\n        cloud computing and infrastructure. I then started shifting my focus\n        from DevOps to full-stack web development mainly using React and\n        building \"microservices\" in Java using Springboot. Throughout this\n        period, the skills I picked up have been invaluable as it helped me\n        understand the full scope overview of software development,\n        infrastructure management, automation and operations. These skills are\n        utilised in the work I do now where I work as a Product Engineer at\n        Optus being involved in the system design, software development and\n        operational support of the newest and most exciting products (in my\n        opinion!).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        With all of this going on up until this year I was sustaining full-time\n        work and a full-time study workload at university but reduced the\n        workload at university in order to stay sane...

Although\n        it's cheesy, it's quite important that I can keep this as a focus and so\n        the work I do and continue to do needs to be meaningful and interesting.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Another important thing I want to keep managing is supporting those I\n        work with to ensure I'm always being able to help them keep moving\n        fowards and improving. Whether this be through providing thoughts and\n        opinions on topics, acting as a \"rubber duck\" to walk through problems,\n        pair-programming or anything, I always want to make sure I'm there to\n        help whilst also staying afloat with the work I am responsible for.\n      </p>\n      <h3>What is next?</h3>\n      <p>\n        Although I still need to continue developing my skills in devops, full\n        stack development and system design, the next thing I'm looking at\n        developing my skills in, is around cybersecurity so hopefully next time\n        you checkout this page, i'll have something exciting to tell you about!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Overall, I'm incredibly proud of what I have been able to achieve and\n        looking forward to
